The Engine
 - Create unique object types
 - Add controls
 - Collision and movement (the actual game stuff)
 - Saving levels (might need to do some lua filesystem stuff)
 - Sprite animation
 - Camera displacement
 - Camera switching
 - Switch to and from editor mode
 - Algorithm to change an objects place in the objects list, 
	and thus it's draw order (depth)
